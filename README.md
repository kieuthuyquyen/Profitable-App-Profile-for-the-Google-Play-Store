# Profitable App Profile for the Google Play Store
The purpose of this project is to analyze possible factors that make an app popular on Google Play Store, based on sample data collected in 2017 which contains details of more than ten thousand android apps. 

In this project, we'll go through a process of cleaning the data, analyzing it to find patterns, and visualizing cleaned data at the last step to make it clearer and easier for stakeholders to understand and make a data-driven decision.
